          <h3>Family</h3>
          <p>Watching our nearly 4-year-old child grow is a delight! She's a little question machine, always curious, and adores storytime. Learning her ABCs and 123s, she's psyched about reading by herself soon. Plus, we've got another munchkin arriving in May
          2024! Here we go again 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧</p>

          <h3>Health</h3>
          <p>Since June, I've been using <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6956846/">blood plasma eye drops</a> to regenerate some of the corneal nerves and heal the eputhelial layer of my eyes. What a game-changer! Come September, I was pain-free and clocked in an average of 3-hour screentime 👁 daily, which allowed me to get back to work a little bit.</p>

          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>I've been <a href="https://hutscape.com/tutorials?search=esp32-c3">tinkering</a> with the super famous ESP32-C3 microcontroller. Planning to use it as the brain for my upcoming home sensor projects. I even whipped up a video showcasing 8 different "hello world" 💡 ways with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SWIAXcH9MuA">Take a look!</a></p>
