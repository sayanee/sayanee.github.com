          <p>Updated on 22 July 2022, Friday, from Singapore</p>

          <h3>Family</h3>
          <p>Our toddler is growing up! With things opening up, we are going out more and exploring as family. It's a joy to give in and answer all the whats, whys and hows. I'm constantly learning how to be a better parent by reading up on toddler psychology and playtimes.</p>

          <h3>Health</h3>
          <p>I think I am finally diagnosed correctly for my eye pain associated with screentime. After years of myopia, contact lens usage, LASIK surgeries and dry eyes, I have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542282/">Neuropathic Occular Pain</a>, which currently has uncertain cure.</p>
          <p>I am continuing to see a team of eye specialists along with my lifestyle that focusses on healthy screentime and I back off as soon as I feel the slightest pain. I fail sometimes, but I am getting better!</p>

          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>I finally learnt FreeCAD, a mechanical CAD design software to design an electronics enclosure. As I get older, learning new things to rewire my brain neurons are important :)</p>
          <p>Really happy that I <a href="https://hutscape.com/oak/case">3D printed the case</a> and shared the entire process of designing it on a <a hre="https://youtu.be/ov3PpaP9uHI">video</a>!</p>
