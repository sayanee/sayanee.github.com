          <h1>Now</h1>
          <p>Updated on 16 Jan 2024, Thursday, from Singapore</p>

          <h3>Family</h3>
          <p>Wow! My youngest is almost 8 months old. I'm so grateful for two healthy childbirths and two very curious preschoolers! Pregnancy, childbirth, recovery, and household chores kept me busy in 2024. I'm trying to savor these fleeting moments of fast changes while they last!</p>

          <h3>Health</h3>
          <p>My eye pain from screen time still flares up occasionally, especially if I run low on a specific eye drop. I took a break from eye appointments due to childbirth, but thankfully, the pain isn't as bad as it was from 2018 to 2023. Slowly working on improving my physical and mental fitness postpartum—I'll get there!</p>

          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>Despite all the challenges (and joys) of family and health, I managed to complete my <a href="https://hutscape.com/capsicum/">WiFi doorbell</a>, and it's already installed at home! I planned to make a video but it's running late—stay tuned! Meanwhile, I'm leveling up my video skills.</p>
